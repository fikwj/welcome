    <h1>Spatializing Kinship</h1>

    <div>
      <p1> <i>Abstract </i> </p1>
        <p> Scholarship has shown that immigrants form mutual support kinship networks based on
          the foundations of a shared cultural background, trust, and obligation. Research also indicates that the ways in which
          immigrants are spatially embedded, namely, the way they engage with urban infrastructure, can create avenues of social 
          and economic integration into the receiving country. However, less is known about how these two processes interact. How do the 
          characteristics of an immigrant kinship network shape how immigrants experience urban spaces? In this paper, I examine this question
          using interviews and fieldwork with West African immigrants who currently or formerly lived in affordable housing cooperatives on
          Chicago’s north side. Beyond engaging in a “socio-spatial” dialectic, I argue that West African immigrants engage in a kinship-spatial dialectic
          with their built environment. Just as the physical features of the building impact tenants’ spatial patterns and social interactions, the features
          of an immigrant kinship network impact the buildings’ symbolic and systemic characteristics. As a result, West African immigrants transform
          buildings in Chicago’s skyline into representations of family, solidarity, and at times, social and spatial immobility. </p>
