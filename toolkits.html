<p> <strong> Basic Steps & Tips to Sustain Student Groups and Orgs w/other Transitory Populations </strong>
<p> Student groups suffer from a constant need to renew membership and leadership. In order to sustain student groups for years to come, use some of the tips below to foster organizational memory and retain membership. </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Establish basic principles and goals for your organization.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Do you plan on teaching workshops, bringing speakers, organizing fundraisers, or all of the above?</li>
<li>Be intentional and clear about what your organization hopes to accomplish for the upcoming school year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Establish channels for communication</strong> (e.g. listserve, Mattermost, Twitter)
<ul>
<li>Hold regular in-person meetings.</li>
<li>Create a mailing list so that everyone in your organization, as well as your campus community, can stay informed about news and updates. Some universities have a mailing list manager that each student organization controls&mdash;it allows them to transfer mailing list ownership as well as manage subscribers.</li>
<li>Social media is an important way to stay connected with your supporters, but it can be difficult to maintain an active presence. Social media management apps (e.g. Hootsuite) can allow anyone in your org to schedule posts. Some platforms also have the capability to schedule posts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Promote events early in the academic term.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Post flyers in campus common areas with high foot traffic (e.g. lounges and cafes)</li>
<li>Create an event page and flyer to begin circulating ASAP. Use different promotional channels. Ask for your event to be featured on mailing lists that capture different campus communities (undergrads, grad students, faculty, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Discuss whether to seek institutional recognition.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Recognition from your home institution can give you access to funds, activity spaces, speaker honorariums, leadership training, and other promotional channels.</li>
<li>If institutional recognition does not threaten your org&rsquo;s operational security it&rsquo;s a worthwhile endeavor!</li>
<li>However, discuss with your organization about whether or not you would like to pursue institutional recognition. The process can be time-consuming and will likely require dedication from different cycles of leaders.</li>
<li>If your org utilizes assertive action models (e.g. direct action, information liberation) or has vulnerable members, university recognition may not be the right choice.</li>
<li>Gaining institutional recognition often requires that a group appears active and sustained for multiple years. If the recognition process becomes too distracting, it might be more sensible to focus on delivering on your org&rsquo;s goals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Define leadership roles.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Depending on how your student org would like to be organized, agreeing on clear roles and responsibilities allows for better operation and avoids one person doing too much work. Ex: Secretary, Treasurer, Communications Manager</li>
<li>Individuals in your organization that don&rsquo;t hold leadership roles need to know how their participation advances the organization&rsquo;s goals. In what capacity are they most helpful? (i.e. promoting and attending events, fundraising, tabling at student fairs, etc.)</li>
<li>Part of establishing formal recognition includes securing a faculty or staff sponsor who will be with the org for more than a couple of years. Faculty sponsors also serve as an org&rsquo;s institutional memory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Agree on a consistent meeting time and place.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Having an established and predictable meeting time tells new members when and where they can start getting involved. Although deciding on a consistent meeting time can be difficult, it is necessary for establishing structure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Establish annual events and workshops</strong>
<ul>
<li>Annual events and workshops give your campus community something to look forward to, and a project that your org can always be working towards. New events can be added throughout the year, depending on your members&rsquo; interests and capacity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>Advertise events with refreshments!</strong>
<ul>
<li>College students are always looking for ways to get free food, this is an easy way to draw an audience!</li>
<li>Budget constraints might make it difficult to supply food for every event. Select events that you want to have a large turnout for. Seek additional funding from academic departments or research centers that are aligned with the event&rsquo;s purpose.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>Recruit new members and collaborate with institutional partners when possible.</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you plan to hold a workshop or event, consider partnering with a research center, library or similarly aligned student group. Your combined networks can help boost your visibility.
<ol>
<li>Brainstorm a spectrum of allies and opponents and organize them by how much power they have in your network/sphere.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Have current members personally invite students to meetings/events. This form of recruitment makes your org more appealing as not only a place to carry out your mission but a space to connect with friends/acquaintances.</li>
<li>Develop leadership by providing opportunities for new members to contribute to org responsibilities. Ask new members to deliver on simple but important tasks (e.g. book event space, bring napkins and plates, etc.)</li>
<li>Create accountability partners. Pair up new and old members so that new members can get to know the org better.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="10">
<li><strong>Formalize your transfer of leadership process.</strong>
<ul>
<li>New leadership should be decided upon before the end of each school year, allowing time for the leadership transition to run smoothly. Establish a transition routine that occurs before members are distracted by finals.</li>
<li>Keep a document detailing the responsibilities of each role and review the document with every new leadership team, make amendments as needed.</li>
<li>Address organization finances during the leadership transition. Discuss the current operational budget, and how to secure funding for the upcoming term. It is helpful to designate 1-2 individuals who are responsible for tracking finances/reimbursements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
