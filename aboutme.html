   <h1> about me </h1>
   <h2> ––––––––– <h2>
   <p> I'm a passionate researcher who is interested in using her interest in digital rights, media and social justice to help design technology and services that better serve marginalized communities. 
   <p> New to the civc tech field , I want to use my strong background as a social science and humanities researcher to inform innovate and creative technology.</p>
   <p>In my free time, I host a bi-weekly WHPK 88.5 FM radio show called OurSpace, a show that aims to explore technology and internet culture at large, and how the intersections of gender, race, class, and sexuality inform the way we engage with it.</p>
