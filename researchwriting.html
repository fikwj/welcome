        <p1><a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/time-and-again-social-media-giants-get-content-moderation-wrong-silencing-speech-about-al-aqsa-mosque-is-just-the-latest-example/" target: "_blank"> Time and Again, Social Media Giants Get Content Moderation Wrong: Silencing Speech about Al-Aqsa Mosque is Just the Latest Example</a> </p1>
        <p style= "font-size: 14px;"> Social media companies often get content moderation wrong — both because of their vague and sweeping rules,
          and because they make mistakes when applying those rules, often through blunt automated detection systems.
          Perfect content moderation may be impossible, but the major platforms can do better. </p>
      
      <p1><a href="toolkits.html" target:"_blank"> Electronic Frontier Alliance Toolkit </a> </p1>
        <p style= "font-size: 14px;"> While interning at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), I conducted research to assess the needs of the Electronic Frontier Alliance (EFA): 
          a network of over 90 grassroots groups promoting digital rights across the country. EFA groups ranged from academic research institutions, to established non-profits 
          and neighborhood advocacy groups. To inform my assessment, I analyzed survey data and conducted in-depth interviews with EFA group leaders; 
          I found that certain EFA groups had difficulty maintaining consistent membership and institutional memory. All of this research culminated in the toolkit linked above.

      <p1><a href="assets/Campus Sexual Assault Movement Analysis CRES 27531.pdf" target:"_blank"> The New Wave: A Movement and Media Analysis of the Contemporary Campus Sexual Assault Movement  </a> </p1>
        <p style= "font-size: 14px;"> My Race, New Media and Youth Movements for Justice course gave me the opportunity to analyze sites of political struggle 
          as they were mediated through technology, social networks and media broadly. In particular, we focused on how past and present social conditions gave 
          rise to a wide range of youth-led movements. The above paper is a media analysis of the campus sexual assault movement, and the ways in which college 
          students leverage their voices, art and power to create a more life-affirming world.

<p1><a href="assets/TJLP Crime & Justice Project SOCI 20255.pdf" target:"_blank"> Slipping Through the Cracks: The Fight for Transformative Justice </a> </p1>
        <p style= "font-size: 14px;"> Crime and deviance are constructed to enforce social norms and create strict boundaries between those in power 
          and those who have been historically marginalized. Through this course—Crime, Justice, and Inequality in the American City—I was given the 
          space to critically examine the impact of policing, incarceration and community-based programs on the city of Chicago. The goal of this independent 
          study was to explore how providing individuals with gender-affirming services is compatible with the call for transformative justice.

      <p1><a href="thesis.html" target:"_blank"> Spatializing Kinship: A Socio-Spatial Analysis of West African Immigrant Kinship
Networks in Affordable Housing Cooperatives </a> </p1>
        <p style= "font-size: 14px;"> As an intern at EFF, I developed new themes of interest for my prospective senior thesis: <i>Physical and Digital Kin </i>. 
          The intent was to explore how African immigrants manage a transnational kinship network with communication technologies while establishing themselves 
          in the United States. However, as research goes, my data analysis revealed an entirely new question: How do the characteristics of an immigrant kinship 
          network shape how immigrants experience urban spaces?  I've linked the finalized research abstract here, but a peer-reviewed version of my thesis to come.
