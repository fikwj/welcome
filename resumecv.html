     <h1> Resume - CV </h1>
  <p>One reason why I created this website was because I felt a stand alone Linkedin Profile didn’t fully showcase my academic, professional and creative capabilities. At first glance, my internship at EFF doesn’t naturally follow my time at the Northwestern Juvenile Project (NJP), but I promise they are connected!
  <p> While at NJP, I helped locate lost participants, often times relying on information gathered from their Facebook profiles. Analyzing a participant’s online presence allowed us to paint a picture of how the participant was faring socially, emotionally and materially. My summer at the Northwestern Juvenile Project showed me the power of consumer data and online networks, leading to an interest in digital rights and the topic for my senior thesis!
